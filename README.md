Decentralized Autonomous Website (DAW) Builder.
Wallet whitelist for Private Previews. Trustless Deployment after proposal voting. 

Make websites truely decentralize by remove trust assumptions in development & deployment, good bye to seat based pricing for collaborations. 
Allow DAOs to have private preview on websites collaborate and vote builds, reduce trust assumptions of website deployment by introducing zk proofs and custom ENS resolver.


## What

Today, one can build a static dWebsite that is censorship resistent, decentralized by hosting it on IPFS, with resolution handled by ens domain. Websites can be updated via IPNS wiith immutable content trails and made persistent with IPFS pinnings. Great tools such as eth.limo and fleek made such approach user friendly. 

Pairing with smart contract, we can create dApp comprised of UI and fully on-chain application states that benefit from security and governance mechanism of Ethereum.

A simple example is a static website that only visualize smart contract states, in a sense it works similar as a dynamic NFT. 

## Challenges of DAW

As billions of websites are not decentralized, we explore challenges and opportunites for making dWebsite greater.

### Private Preview for DAO collaboraitons
Existing platforms such as Github, Vercel are hard to utilized by DAO teams.
High seat-based pricing and lack of gate access control mechanisms with web3 identity (e.g. wallets), made typical DAO collaboration impossible.

In particualr, private previews and review/voting on proposal are often essential for websites, while IPFS has no content encryption and teams fallback to small trusted core team andcentralized identity for collaboration.  

To solve this, we create web3 identity friendly whitelist mechanism for website previews. Whitelist is made free. 


### Trusted
Websites subject to all sort of attack vectors, from DNS registrar, supply chain attack at NPM to various hosting concerns. Censorship resistance is not guarantee on hosted platforms and pipelines always require priviledged access.

How could we bring on-chain security to make websites more autonomous, add guardrails and make changes more trackable?


We see a lot of use cases from DAW, from displaying censorship-sensitive key information, Whistle Bowling, Crowdfunding, Community Notes, Internet Archive to where fair mechanisms is in need such  Autonomous World or Advertisement.

### custom Hybrid resolver
- we deployed a Hybrid resolver which is able to resolve both on and off chain data.
- source code of gateway is under `apps/gateway`, originally maintained at separate forked repository [ens-offchain-registrar](
https://github.com/debuggingfuture/ens-offchain-registrar)

Current fleek is used as ipfs gateway and to ease deployment & faster pinning, while it is not necessary as we could run own ipfs nodes

### custom whitelist
Trust assumption. The demo use non-decentralized infrastructure cloudflare worker for deployment, however that is good trade-off given it is only preview but not public websites. That could be replace by D1 compatabilie techstack such as tableland.


### Proof of Build

- Using Next.js static websites as an example, we can gather fingerprint from the build (under `/out` directory)
 - routes (`/route1` create route1.html)
 - file hashes (CID via multiformat package as used by ipfs)

<!-- Owner and deployer segregation -->

- verifyBuild
<!-- - executed by sequencer -->
- generate signature 
 - prefer standard contenthash resolver
- further automate the trustless process once Protokit is able to roll up to L1 and the production EVM bridge is deployed.

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- `ui`: a stub React component library with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Building packages/ui

This example is set up to produce compiled styles for `ui` components into the `dist` directory. The component `.tsx` files are consumed by the Next.js apps directly using `transpilePackages` in `next.config.js`. This was chosen for several reasons:

- Make sharing one `tailwind.config.js` to apps and packages as easy as possible.
- Make package compilation simple by only depending on the Next.js Compiler and `tailwindcss`.
- Ensure Tailwind classes do not overwrite each other. The `ui` package uses a `ui-` prefix for it's classes.
- Maintain clear package export boundaries.

Another option is to consume `packages/ui` directly from source without building. If using this option, you will need to update the `tailwind.config.js` in your apps to be aware of your package locations, so it can find all usages of the `tailwindcss` class names for CSS compilation.

For example, in [tailwind.config.js](packages/tailwind-config/tailwind.config.js):

```js
  content: [
    // app content
    `src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}`,
    // include packages if not transpiling
    "../../packages/ui/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
```

If you choose this strategy, you can remove the `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` dependencies from the `ui` package.

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styles
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
